3 [<option>: ]missing argument[s][: <arguments>...]
  Not enough arguments have been passed down to the program or to an option of
   the program.
  {mp arguments} may be the placeholder name of the missing arguments.
4 [<option>: ]too many arguments[: <n>]
  Too many arguments have been passed down to the program or to an option of the

10 [<option>: ]<argument>: not a[n] (number|integer)

  {mp relational_op} may be the four relational operators: {c <=}, {c <}, {c >}
   or {c >=}
  {mp limit} may either be the minumum, floor, maximum or ceiling value.
12 [<option>: ]<argument>: does not match: <pattern>
