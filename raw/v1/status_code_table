   the program.
  {mp arguments} may be the placeholder name of the missing arguments.
4 [<option>: ]too many arguments[: <n>]
  Too many arguments have been passed down to the program or to an option of the

  {mp relational_op} may be the four relational operators: {c <=}, {c <}, {c >}
   or {c >=}
  {mp limit} may either be the minumum, floor, maximum or ceiling value.
